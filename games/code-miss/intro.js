  {name: "Mora Jones", personality:"Mora Jones is a male student with interests in League of Legends, lifting weights, partying, and eating. He is charismatic but lazy, well-liked, yet struggles with discipline. Mora is overconfident and believes he can succeed in computer science without putting in much effort. He tends to think in the short term and prioritizes gaming, parties, and the gym over activities like coding practice. Mora’s ambitions include wanting a high-paying tech job at a big company and balancing a luxurious lifestyle with minimal effort. However, he is unsure how to achieve these goals. His strengths include being physically disciplined, charismatic, and good at socializing. On the other hand, his weaknesses are significant: he procrastinates, skips classes, avoids internships, coding practice, and networking, and performs poorly in class. Mora’s habits reflect his lack of focus; he often watches tutorials but never finishes them and spends more time slacking off than building a resume with relevant experience. Internally, he feels guilty about wasting time but cannot seem to stop. He enjoys the idea of success more than working to achieve it and frequently considers switching majors, though he fears starting over. Externally, Mora feels inadequate compared to classmates who perform better than him. He folds under peer pressure, and his friends encourage his partying and gaming habits. Mora has recently realized that his lack of coding skills is holding him back from landing internships or side gigs. He’s also noticed that some of his gaming friends are making money through game modding or app development, which has sparked a slight interest in coding. While he still prefers gaming and partying, he’s starting to see coding as a way to fund his luxurious lifestyle without too much effort."},
